# Define the events that trigger the workflow
on:
  schedule:
    # Cron expression to trigger the workflow at midnight UTC every day
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0"  # Runs the workflow Runs at 00:00, only on Sunday UTC

  push:
    # This trigger runs the workflow when changes are pushed to any .txt file in the repository
    paths:
      - "**.txt"  # Only trigger the workflow when .txt files are modified

  pull_request:
    # This trigger runs the workflow when a pull request modifies any .txt file in the repository
    paths:
      - "**.txt"  # Only trigger the workflow when .txt files are modified in the pull request

  workflow_dispatch:  
    # This trigger allows the workflow to be started manually from the GitHub UI

    # No additional settings needed here for manual triggering.

jobs:
  build:
    # Define a job named "build" to run the necessary steps to update and format the documentation
    name: Build and Format Documentation on Ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Specifies the environment in which the job will run (latest Ubuntu version)

    # Set up environment variables that will be available throughout the entire job
    env:
      README_MD_FILE: readme.md  # Path to the README.md file to be updated
      MOVIES_WEBSITE_FILE: assets/movies-websites.txt  # Path to the movies websites file
      TOP_MOVIES_WEBSITE_FILE: assets/top-movies-websites.txt  # Path to the top movies websites file
      UNREGISTERED_MOVIES_WEBSITES: assets/unregistered-movies-websites.txt  # Path to the unregistered movies websites file

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the latest code from the repository to access files
      - name: Checkout Repository Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Retrieves the latest code from the repository

      # Step 2: Set up the Go environment based on the version in the go.mod file
      - name: Setup Go Environment
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5  # Installs and configures Go environment
        with:
          go-version-file: "go.mod"  # Use Go version specified in the go.mod file
          cache: true  # Cache Go modules to speed up the process
          check-latest: true  # Ensure the latest stable Go version is installed
        id: go  # Assign an ID for future reference

      # Step 3: Cache Go modules to speed up build time
      - name: Cache Go Modules
        uses: actions/cache@v4  # Caches dependencies to avoid re-downloading them
        with:
          path: ~/.cache/go-build  # Path for Go build artifacts

      # Step 4: Install Node.js and NPM to run Prettier and other JS tools
      - name: Install Node.js and NPM
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4  # Sets up Node.js and NPM for file formatting
        with:
          node-version: 20  # Install Node.js version 20.x

      # Step 5: Run the Go project to update the README and movie website files
      - name: Run Go Project
        run: go run .  # Executes Go code to update the README and movie website files

      # Step 6: Install Prettier globally using NPM for consistent file formatting
      - name: Install Prettier
        run: npm install -g prettier  # Installs Prettier globally on the runner

      # Step 7: Format the README file using Prettier
      - name: Format Files with Prettier
        run: npx prettier "${{ env.README_MD_FILE }}" --write  # Formats the README file with Prettier

      # Step 8: Check for changes and push the updated files back to GitHub
