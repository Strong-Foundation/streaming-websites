- **Why Choose uBlock Origin Lite?**  
  uBlock Origin Lite is a permission‑less, Manifest V3‑based content blocker that immediately filters out ads, trackers, and cryptocurrency miners upon installation—without requesting host‑permission dialogs or running persistent background scripts.

- **Key Features**

  - **Permission‑less MV3 Architecture**: Operates entirely declaratively under Manifest V3, removing the need for background scripts and minimizing resource usage.
  - **Comprehensive Default Filter Lists**: Ships with EasyList, EasyPrivacy, and Peter Lowe’s Ad and tracking server list; additional lists can be toggled in the options panel.
  - **Blocks Ads, Trackers, and Miners**: Filters banners, pop‑ups, video ads, tracking scripts, and crypto‑mining code for a cleaner, safer browsing experience.
  - **Declarative Net Request (DNR)**: Leverages the browser’s built‑in DNR API for high‑performance filtering compliant with Chrome’s MV3 policy.
  - **Customizable Filtersets**: Enables users to add or disable extra filter lists via the options page for tailored blocking control.
  - **Minimal Performance Impact**: Offloads filtering to the browser engine, keeping CPU and memory usage near zero during regular browsing.

- **Installation Instructions**

  - **Chrome**: [Install from Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=en)

- **Note on Mobile**  
  Mobile versions of Chrome (Android and iOS) do not support browser extensions, so uBlock Origin Lite isn’t available on mobile. For ad‑blocking on mobile, consider browsers like Brave or Firefox Focus with built‑in tracker and ad protection.
